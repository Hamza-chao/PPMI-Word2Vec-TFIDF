# PPMI, Word2Vec, and TF-IDF from Scratch

This repository contains my implementations of three key NLP techniques—**PPMI**, **Word2Vec**, and **TF-IDF**—built entirely from scratch. I developed and tested these algorithms using a dataset of TED talk transcripts, and I provided heatmap visualizations to showcase data insights.

## Project Overview

- **PPMI**: Calculated the Positive Pointwise Mutual Information to capture word association strengths.
- **Word2Vec**: Implemented a model to learn vector representations of words.
- **TF-IDF**: Developed a method to weigh the importance of words within the TED talk dataset.
- **Heatmap Visualizations**: Created heatmaps to visually represent the relationships and patterns in the data.

Each method was designed to work on raw data, providing insights into the semantic relationships within the TED talks.

## Dataset

The project uses a TED talk dataset, which consists of transcripts from various TED talks, enabling an in-depth analysis of language patterns and word associations.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepositoryname.git
