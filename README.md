# PPMI, Word2Vec, and TF-IDF from Scratch

This repository contains my implementations of three key NLP techniques—**PPMI**, **Word2Vec**, and **TF-IDF**—built entirely from scratch. I developed and tested these algorithms using a dataset of TED talk transcripts, and I provided heatmap visualizations to showcase data insights.

## Project Overview

- **PPMI**: Calculated the Positive Pointwise Mutual Information to capture word association strengths.
- **Word2Vec**: Implemented a model to learn vector representations of words.
- **TF-IDF**: Developed a method to weigh the importance of words within the TED talk dataset.
- **Heatmap Visualizations**: Created heatmaps to visually represent the relationships and patterns in the data.

## Dataset

The project uses a TED talk dataset, which consists of transcripts from various TED talks.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepositoryname.git
